1. Tables with Supabase
2. Policy allow all (true)
3. Database connection and queries in the backend and frontend
4. React Routes (learn, but not needed now)
5. Learn TailwindCSS
6. Auth with Supabase: install the login component.

note from authWrapper.jsx: both && and ? : are valid â€” but && is just cleaner when you only want to render something or nothing.
So this is basically the same:
      {authStep == "login" && <LoginForm setAuthStep={setAuthStep}/>}
      {authStep == "login" ? <LoginForm setAuthStep={setAuthStep}/> : null}

7. Fix the links between the forgot password login and sign in forms.
8. FIx the Supabase Client call, and create a client only once inside the lib client folder and update the login components from the older createClient function. 
This is much more efficient that calling it multiple times in different files, now I can just import the client.js file and work with supabase anywhere.
9. Create a Sign Out button and add visual changes when logged in or logged out.
10. Update Policies
